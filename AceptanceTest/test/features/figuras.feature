Feature: Compute factorial
	In order to play with Lettuce As beginners Weâ€™ll implement factorial

Scenario: Square area
	Given I have the "square" and side = 3 
	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area 9
Scenario: Square area
	Given I have the "square" and side = 5
	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area 25
Scenario: Square area
	Given I have the "square" and side = 7 
	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area 49


Scenario: Circle area
	Given I have the "circle" and radius = 5
	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area "78.54"
Scenario: Circle area
	Given I have the "circle" and radius = 3
	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area "28.2744"

	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area 16


Scenario: Triangle area
	Given I have the "triangle" with base = 6 and height = 5 
	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area 15
Scenario: Triangle area
	Given I have the "triangle" with base = 9 and height = 3 
	When I compute its area
	Then I see the area "13"
Scenario: Triangle area
